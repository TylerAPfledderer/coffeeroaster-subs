This project comes from the [Coffeeroasters subscription site challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/coffeeroasters-subscription-site-5Fc26HVY6). It has been altered to provide improved interpretation of vertical rhythm and typescale principles in the design.

## Overview

This is a design-to-code project to showcase products in a subscription-based e-commerce site. The featured functionality is a form containing your options when setting up the subscription, up until the point of starting a "checkout" process. For the the purposes of this project, the checkout will simply reset the options. Persistant state on refresh with Local Storage is provided.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Make selections to create a coffee subscription and see an order summary modal of their choices
  - Once the user selects the "Checkout" button on the modal, a confirmation toast appears, and the selections reset to the default values.
